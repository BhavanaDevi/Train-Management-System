# Train Management System

## Description 

The train management system enables users to, among other things, purchase and cancel tickets, check the status of their reserved tickets, and inquire about the availability of trains depending on their boarding station and arrival station. The objective of this case study is to create a database that contains data about different trains, railway statuses, and passengers. In contrast to the train status record, which includes the dates for which tickets can be purchased as well as the total number of seats available and the number of seats that have already been reserved, the train record comprises the number, name, source, destination, and days on which the train is available.

By inputting the boarding station, arrival station, and date of travel, passengers can search for trains. The availability of any trains will be indicated. After that, visitors can purchase their tickets. The user will receive a confirmation email with the ticket details along with a ticket that contains the passenger information. A traveller must first enter their PNR number before they can cancel their tickets.By entering the train number and the date of the trip, passengers can also search the running status of the train.
